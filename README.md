AI-Based Deep Learning Stock Forecasting System

This project is an **AI-Powered Stock Forecasting Web Application** built using a fine-tuned **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** deep learning model.  
It can predict the next 10 days of stock prices with approximately **70% accuracy**, trained on **years of historical market data** using a **120-day rolling window** to capture both long-term and short-term patterns.
